Originally written at `Dynamic Controls <https://dynamiccontrols.com>`__

Originally written by Ben Powell as a thin wrapper around the Kvaser SDK
to support the leaf device.

Support for linux socketcan was added by Rose Lu as a summer coding
project in 2011. The socketcan interface was helped immensely by Phil Dixon
who wrote a leaf-socketcan driver for Linux.

The pcan interface was contributed by Albert Bloomfield in 2013.

The usb2can interface was contributed by Joshua Villyard in 2015

The IXXAT VCI interface was contributed by Giuseppe Corbelli and funded
by `Weightpack <http://www.weightpack.com>`__ in 2016

The NI-CAN and virtual interfaces plus the ASCII and BLF loggers were
contributed by Christian Sandberg in 2016 and 2017. The BLF format is based on
a C++ library by Toby Lorenz.

The slcan interface, ASCII listener and log logger and listener were contributed by Eduard Br√∂cker in 2017.


Support for CAN within Python
-----------------------------

The 'socket' module contains support for SocketCAN from Python 3.3.

From Python 3.4 broadcast management commands are natively supported.
