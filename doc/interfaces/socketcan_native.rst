SocketCAN (python)
==================

Python 3.3 added support for socketcan for linux systems.

The socketcan_native interface directly uses Python's socket module to 
access SocketCAN on linux. This is the most direct route to the kernel
and should provide the most responsive.

The implementation features efficient filtering of can_id's, this filtering
occurs in the kernel and is much much more efficient than filtering messages
in Python.

Python 3.4 added support for the Broadcast Connection Manager (BCM)
protocol, which if enabled should be used for queueing periodic tasks.
