The **C**\ ontroller **A**\ rea **N**\ etwork is a bus standard designed
to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other. It
has priority based bus arbitration, reliable deterministic
communication. It is used in cars, trucks, boats, wheelchairs and more.

The ``can`` package provides controller area network support for
Python developers; providing `common abstractions to
different hardware devices`, and a suite of utilities for sending and receiving
messages on a can bus.

The library supports Python 2.7, Python 3.3+ as well as PyPy and runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.

You can find more information in the documentation, online at
`python-can.readthedocs.org <https://python-can.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__.
