The **C**\ ontroller **A**\ rea **N**\ etwork is a bus standard designed
to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other. It
has priority based bus arbitration and reliable deterministic
communication. It is used in cars, trucks, boats, wheelchairs and more.

The ``can`` package provides controller area network support for
Python developers; providing common abstractions to
different hardware devices, and a suite of utilities for sending and receiving
messages on a can bus.

The library currently supports CPython as well as PyPy and runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.

==============================  ===========
Library Version                 Python
------------------------------  -----------
  2.x                           2.6+, 3.4+
  3.x                           2.7+, 3.5+
  4.x *(currently on develop)*  3.7+
==============================  ===========


Features
--------

- common abstractions for CAN communication
- support for many different backends (see the `docs <https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces.html>`__)
- receiving, sending, and periodically sending messages
- normal and extended arbitration IDs
- `CAN FD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_FD>`__ support
- many different loggers and readers supporting playback: ASC (CANalyzer format), BLF (Binary Logging Format by Vector), CSV, SQLite and Canutils log
- efficient in-kernel or in-hardware filtering of messages on supported interfaces
- bus configuration reading from a file or from environment variables
- command line tools for working with CAN buses (see the `docs <https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scripts.html>`__)
- more


Example usage
-------------

.. code:: python

    # import the library
    import can

    # create a bus instance
    # many other interfaces are supported as well (see documentation)
    bus = can.Bus(interface='socketcan',
                  channel='vcan0',
                  receive_own_messages=True)

    # send a message
    message = can.Message(arbitration_id=123, is_extended_id=True,
                          data=[0x11, 0x22, 0x33])
    bus.send(message, timeout=0.2)

    # iterate over received messages
    for msg in bus:
        print(f"{msg.arbitration_id:X}: {msg.data}")

    # or use an asynchronous notifier
    notifier = can.Notifier(bus, [can.Logger("recorded.log"), can.Printer()])
