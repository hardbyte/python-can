This module contains various scripts, like a logfile writer and a logfile player.

.. note::
    The scripts reside in here so they can be launched as modules. That makes them
    more easily callable on different platforms. But they they can also be called
    directly (mostly on Unix systems), because they are also installed as scripts
    from ``python-can/scripts/*``.
    See PR #370.
