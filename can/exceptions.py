"""
There are several specific :class:`Exception` classes to allow user
code to react to specific scenarios related to CAN busses::

    Exception (Python standard library)
     +-- ...
     +-- CanError (python-can)
         +-- CanInterfaceNotImplementedError
         +-- CanInitializationError
         +-- CanOperationError
         +-- CanTimeoutError

Keep in mind that some functions and methods may raise different exceptions.
For example, validating typical arguments and parameters might result in a
:class:`ValueError`. This should always be documented for the function at hand.
