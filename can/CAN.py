This module was once the core of python-can, containing
implementations of all the major classes in the library, now
however all functionality has been refactored out. This API
is left intact for version 2.0 to 2.3 to aide with migration.

WARNING: 
This module is deprecated an will get removed in version 2.4. 
Please use `import can` instead.
