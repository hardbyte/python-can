Version 4.0.0
====

TL;DR: This release includes a ton of improvements from 2.5 years of development! 🎉 Test thoroughly after switching.

For more than two years, there was no major release of *python-can*.
However, development was very much active over most of this time, and many parts were switched out and improved.
Over this time, over 530 issues and PRs have been resolved or merged, and discussions took place in even more.
Statistics of the final diff: About 200 files changed due to ~22k additions and ~7k deletions from more than thirty contributors.

This changelog diligently lists the major changes but does not promise to be the complete list of changes.
Therefore, users are strongly advised to thoroughly test their programs against this new version.
Re-reading the documentation for your interfaces might be helpful too as limitations and capabilities might have changed or are more explicit.
While we did try to avoid breaking changes, in some cases it was not feasible and in particular, many implementation details have changed.

Behind the scenes & Quality assurance
-------------------------------------

* We publish both source distributions (`sdist`) and binary wheels (`bdist_wheel`) (#1059, #1071)
* Many interfaces were partly rewritten to modernize the code or to better handle errors
* Performance improvements
* Dependencies have changed
* Derive type information in Sphinx docs directly from type hints (#654)
* Better documentation in many, many places; This includes the examples, README and python-can developer resources
* Add issue templates (#1008, #1017, #1018, #1178)
* Many continuous integration (CI) discussions & improvements (for example: #951, #940, #1032)
  * Use the [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) static type checker (#598, #651)
  * Use [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) for testing (#582, #833, #870)
  * Use [Mergify](https://mergify.com/) (#821, #835, #937)
  * Switch between various CI providers, abandoned [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) (#1009) and partly [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), ended up with mostly [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) (#827, #1224)
  * Use the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) auto-formatter (#950)
  * [Good test coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/hardbyte/python-can/branch/develop) for all but the interfaces
* Testing: Many of the new features directly added tests, and coverage of existing code was improved too (for example: #1031, #581, #585, #586, #942, #1196, #1198)

Version 3.1.1
====

Major features
--------------

Two new interfaces this release:

- SYSTEC contributed by @idaniel86 in PR #466
- CANalyst-II contributed by @smeng9 in PR #476


Other notable changes
---------------------

* #477 The kvaser interface now supports bus statistics via a custom bus method.
* #434 neovi now supports receiving own messages
* #490 Adding option to override the neovi library name
* #488 Allow simultaneous access to IXXAT cards

Version 3.1.0
====

Version 3.1.0 was built with old wheel and/or setuptools
packages and was replaced with v3.1.1 after an installation
but was discovered.

Version 3.0.0
====

Major features
--------------

* Adds support for developing `asyncio` applications with `python-can` more easily. This can be useful
  when implementing protocols that handles simultaneous connections to many nodes since you can write
  synchronous looking code without handling multiple threads and locking mechanisms. #388
* New can viewer terminal application. (`python -m can.viewer`) #390
* More formally adds task management responsibility to the `Bus`. By default tasks created with
  `bus.send_periodic` will have a reference held by the bus - this means in many cases the user
  doesn't need to keep the task in scope for their periodic messages to continue being sent. If
  this behavior isn't desired pass `store_task=False` to the `send_periodic` method. Stop all tasks
  by calling the bus's new `stop_all_periodic_tasks` method. #412


Breaking changes
----------------

* Interfaces should no longer override `send_periodic` and instead implement
  `_send_periodic_internal` to allow the Bus base class to manage tasks. #426
* writing to closed writers is not supported any more (it was supported only for some)
* the file in the reader/writer is now always stored in the attribute uniformly called `file`, and not in
  something like `fp`, `log_file` or `output_file`. Changed the name of the first parameter of the
  read/writer constructors from `filename` to `file`.


Other notable changes
---------------------

* can.Message class updated #413
    - Addition of a `Message.equals` method.
    - Deprecate id_type in favor of is_extended_id
    - Initializer parameter extended_id deprecated in favor of is_extended_id
    - documentation, testing and example updates
    - Addition of support for various builtins: __repr__, __slots__, __copy__
* IO module updates to bring consistency to the different CAN message writers and readers. #348
    - context manager support for all readers and writers
    - they share a common super class called `BaseIOHandler`
    - all file handles can now be closed with the `stop()` method
    - the table name in `SqliteReader`/`SqliteWriter` can be adjusted
    - append mode added in `CSVWriter` and `CanutilsLogWriter`
    - [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) and
      [path-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) objects can now be passed to
      the readers and writers (except to the Sqlite handlers)
    - add a `__ne__()` method to the `Message` class (this was required by the tests)
    - added a `stop()` method for `BufferedReader`
    - `SqliteWriter`: this now guarantees that all messages are being written, exposes some previously internal metrics
      and only buffers messages up to a certain limit before writing/committing to the database.
    - the unused `header_line` attribute from `CSVReader` has been removed
    - privatized some attributes that are only to be  used internally in the classes
    - the method `Listener.on_message_received()` is now abstract (using `@abc.abstractmethod`)
* Start testing against Python 3.7 #380
* All scripts have been moved into `can/scripts`. #370, #406
* Added support for additional sections to the config #338
* Code coverage reports added. #346, #374
* Bug fix to thread safe bus. #397
